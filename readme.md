# Decentralized job application - PNK token holders to decide


TLDR:
- I was thinking about working with Kleros for a long time.
- I was waiting for the right timing (around the 2nd round token sale).
- I spoke with Federico and Stuart suggesting some improvements to the [escrow](https://escrow.kleros.io).
- Had a chance to spend some time face-to-face in the UK and discuss in more details.

### Why starting with escrow?
I have reported 20+ [issues](https://github.com/kleros/escrow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Amarsrobertson):

* We need to be better.
* I am taking ownership of that piece.
* I suggest hourly rate for the start.
* We could think forever about milestones.
* Not possible to know exactly the scope of the work before doing some work first.

### Part-time contracting salary

Looking at the market to see what is reasonable

- https://angel.co/company/kleros/jobs

2016-2017 I was earning £500 + VAT per day. £600 was $800, that equals $100 per hour.

Currently on £76k salary that equals to $100k year.

According to the [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/b428ed1a/London) I'm in the 90 percentile of software engineerinig salaries in London.

Here is what I suggest for the start:
- Try before you buy.
- Do not marry on the first date. 
- $50 per hour (half of my old rate)
- 10 hours per week

Generously compensated in stock options (vested PNK ) to ensure aligned incentives:
- 1% (10m) 
- 4 years vesting 
- 6 months cliff
- the vesting period starting Wednesday 22nd January 2020

I fully support salary transparency, just like [Buffer spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11s9VSyf4yaYUsqBKLaVH78NL8wdl8gXoj5BGAzjIFuc/edit#gid=671465451).

### Going full-time: Chief Integration Officer

For the first couple of months I'll keep my existing job. This is to a number of reasons related to immigration and credit affordability.

Once these issues are cleared, working with Kleros full-time to ensure healthy ecosystem:
* More cases
* More earnings
* More demand for token
* Higher prices means solid crypto-economy, cost of 51% attack goes up

Main responsibilities:
* Adoption
* Usability
* User-experience

Hacking-experience:
* Deploy your own PNK
* Deploy your own court hierarchy
* Assign PNK to your accounts
* Stake PNK in relevant courts
* Forward time in one click to simulate various outcomes of the jurors vote
* If you know how to use MetaMask and run `git clone`, `npm install` and `npm start` then you should be good to go

Human-experience
* Game theory experiments
* Control group
* Education about the 

Cross-blockchain (EOS, Tron, Liberland, grant)

Marketing outreach: make it 10x better to onboard next million crypto users.

Onboarding the next million users.

(because all dapps ideas are exhausted, you are already on the case)

> “Chinese importers in Russia are buying up to $30 million a day of tether (USDT) from Moscow’s over-the-counter trading desks.”

* Fast
* Cheap
* Borderless
* Censorship resistant

Enough incentive to make the switch.

Just like like flying to Mars is possible because of the properties:
* Reuse rockets
* Assemble ship on the orbit
* Send cargo first
* Manufacture fuel on Mars



### Internal motivation

Had some encounters with legacy legal system:
* 2017 messy divorce
* 4 different court threads (divorce, children, money, non-molestation)
* 10 hearings
* 2 years write off

Now rebuilding myself.

### Google Doc (existing work)
Initial guidellines in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axqQAOVhtR8fFV63W1J5BNC4uTxJYEwt0i9GZPDNxOo/edit?usp=sharing).

Finding the balance between research and development:
> I’m thinking about my primary skill set -  I have skills as a developer.
> I can surely fork the smart contract and make the necessary adjustments.
> I am familiar with the Solidity codebase.
> In fact, I've already earned some profit: https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/issues/243#issuecomment-491905442
> I am less familiar with the React front-end but if needed can make necessary fixes too: https://github.com/kleros/escrow/pull/68
> I think about the balance, best of both worlds:
> * Phase 1: User research first so we know exactly what we are doing
> * Phase 2: Then developing the functionalities

> Can we make this Google Doc public?
> This is because it will be PNK holders who would vote whether to hire me.
> I would like them to know the existing results of my work - it will help them make better, more informed decisions.
> Additional reason - I would like to ask people about their experience (using escrow). Some use cases require more work. We were discussing creating a blog post with “call for research”.

### Vote against

- Nothing personal.
- Do what is in your best interest as a token holder. Doing anything else would be irrational.
- I'd probably reduce my stack of PNK to `0.5m` and let the other guys do the work.
- *(with the full confidence there are guys better than me)*
- Surely I'd reduce my activity on the Telegram, Forum, Slack and other channels to reclaim my time and focus on other money making activities.
- In fact, I'll reduce my Telegram trolling one way or another. You'll still be able to find me in Github commits, technical discussions on Slack and in-depth post on the Forum.
- I will vote to hire me with my own stack because I know it's in my own best interest as a person, as well as the PNK holder. 

**DYOR**

### Applicable law
- I'm originally from Europe.
- I have established my first limited company in the UK in 2011
- 2017 I have opened a company in [E-Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Estonia)
- Kleros Cooperative is a French entity.
- Any dispute to be resolved by the Kleros court, employment arbitration category (to be created).


### Discussion
- I encourage discussion and feedback.
- I encourage the existing core team to comment and vote with their PNK, in fact I want to make it the highest attendance vote ever.
- https://governance.kleros.io/ - so far the votes attracted up to 4%... I'd really to see 10% turnout, that would be amazing, with new token holders *(2nd round of sale) I believe it is possible!

### Meta-meta-meta-marketing.
- Forum post with decentralized job application job offer is **marketing**.
- Google Doc asking for your input is **marketing**.
- Asking to vote with your PNK is **marketing** *(it shows that DAOs can make decisions, thrive, operate fast)*

PS. Here are the instructions how to build icosahedron: https://steemit.com/kleros/@genesisre/kleros-icosahedron-why-don-t-try-the-recipe-yourself
PPS. Even if the outcome of the vote is "NO" I'm hopning to earn some PNK via [storytelling bounty](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-storytelling-reward-program/) - past two years with Kleros been one hell of a ride and I'm hoping to continue this adventure.
