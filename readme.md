# Decentralized job application - PNK token holders to decide

The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application) is the single source of truth, from there propagated to the [Kleros forum](https://forum.kleros.io/t/decentralized-job-application-pnk-token-holders-to-decide/349).


# Wrapping up (7 Mar 2020)

### Benefits of not being employed
* As someone who is not employed by Kleros I have more freedom to pursue other projects.
* I can totally legally officially talk about psychedelic science.
* In many jurisdictions it remains illegal. My personal interests could harm reputation of Kleros.

### There are some regrets thought
* Not addressing the most important issue, after the fact I've learnt it's was about my salary expectations?
* Month "hanging on" and draining energy
* The proposal did not make it the voting stage, that would be making history

### Suggested `100k PNK` payment for the completed work

**Arrival 1:** 20 hours, $50 per hour, PNK was at 0.01 at the time when the work was done

**Arrival 2:** bounties pay much more, I suggested [meta-dogfooding bounty](https://forum.kleros.io/t/storytelling-bounty-distribution-of-the-rewards-kleros-meta-dogfooding/352/8), but instead we got a [contentious spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPWm69LkhGTqs4dDaydhYUQs1potq7nrYArHcB5bbf0/edit#gid=0) that paid 100k for 3 tweets:

*(Decentralized Job Application is not billable time)*

*(endless negotiation on Slack were negative value, some discount from `100k PNK` possible, negotiable, agreeable)*

### Moving on

I'm keen to work with Kleros in the future at the rate that reflects my value in the labour marketplace.

I'll continue to extract "free money" from various bounties.

*(the intention was to skip bounties and focus on meaningful work)*

Note that it is almost never "free money", there is always some work involved but at a much higher hourly rate than work suggested in the Decentralised Job Application.

# Old stuff (8 Feb 2020)

Original [v0.1](https://github.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application/releases/tag/v0.1) preserved below. This is to make it easier for anyone less technical (ability to navigate GitHub) to see what was at stake.

The past two years with Kleros have been one hell of a ride. I'm hoping to start working with Kleros officially.

- I was thinking about applying for a job for a long time.
- I was waiting for the right timing (around the 2nd round token sale).
- I spoke with Federico and Stuart suggesting some improvements to the [escrow.kleros.io](https://escrow.kleros.io).
- I had a chance to spend some time face-to-face in the UK and discuss in more detail.

> An unforgettable week in the UK that included reunion with old friends, several talks and the first decentralized justice conference in history!

### Why starting with escrow?
I have reported 20+ [issues](https://github.com/kleros/escrow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Amarsrobertson):

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application/master/images/escrow-bugs.png" width="600px">

* We need to be better.
* I am taking ownership of that piece.
* I know the Solidity smart contract: https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/issues/243#issuecomment-491905442
* I know how to make fixes to React front-end: https://github.com/kleros/escrow/pull/68
* I suggest hourly rate for the start.
* We could think forever about milestones.
* Not possible to know exactly the scope of the work before doing some work first.

I believe escrow is so revolutionary, it can onboard to crypto next million users.

> “Chinese importers in Russia are buying up to $30 million a day of tether (USDT) from Moscow’s over-the-counter trading desks.”

Escrow payments provide enough incentive to switch to crypto:
* Fast
* Cheap
* Borderless
* Censorship resistant

Just like like flying to Mars, multiple breakthroughs are making it possible:
* Reuse rockets
* Assemble ship on the orbit
* Send cargo first
* Manufacture fuel on Mars

### Part-time contracting salary

For the first couple of months I'll keep my existing job. This is for a number of reasons:
- immigration (BREXIT)
- credit affordability (investing in real-estate)
- try before you buy, do not marry on the first date

Let's see what is reasonable: https://angel.co/company/kleros/jobs

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application/master/images/angel-jobs.png" width="600px">

- 2016-2017 I was earning £500 + VAT per day. £600 was $800 that equals $100 per hour.
- Currently on £76k salary that equals to $100k year.
- According to the [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/b428ed1a/London) I'm in the 90 percentile of software engineerinig salaries in London.
- Checking [transparency report](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-transparency-report/) - 180m allocated for team members.
- I fully support salary transparency, just like the [Buffer spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11s9VSyf4yaYUsqBKLaVH78NL8wdl8gXoj5BGAzjIFuc/edit#gid=671465451).

Here is what I suggest for the start:
- $50 per hour (half of my old rate)
- 10 hours per week

Compensated in stock options (vested PNK) to ensure aligned incentives:
- 0.5% (see also [this issue](https://github.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application/issues/1))
- 4 years vesting 
- 6 months cliff
- the vesting period starting Wednesday 22nd January 2020 (date of the initial call)
- during the part-time period, the vesting is at 50% speed

*(that incentivizes me to join full-time sooner, how soon is "soon" check [this issue](https://github.com/marsrobertson/decentralized-job-application/issues/3))*

### Going full-time: Chief Integration Officer

Overarching mission to ensure healthy ecosystem:
* Adoption
* Usability
* User-experience

Simple logic, I think everyone can resonate with it:
* More cases
* More earnings for jurors
* More demand for the token
* Higher prices means solid crypto-economy, cost of 51% attack goes up

Hacking-experience:
* Deploy your own PNK
* Deploy your own court hierarchy
* Assign PNK to test accounts
* Stake PNK in relevant courts
* Forward time in one click to simulate various outcomes of the jurors vote
* If you know how to use MetaMask and run `git clone`, `npm install` and `npm start` then you should be good to go

Human-experience:
* Beyond pure rational mathematical crypto economics game theory
* Education about the Kleros protocol

### Internal motivation

Had some encounters with legacy legal system:
* 2017 messy divorce
* 4 different court threads (divorce, children, money, non-molestation)
* 10 hearings
* 2 years write off

> I think about the balance, best of both worlds:
> * Phase 1: User research first so we know exactly what we are doing
> * Phase 2: Then developing the functionalities
>
> Can we make this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axqQAOVhtR8fFV63W1J5BNC4uTxJYEwt0i9GZPDNxOo/edit?usp=sharing) public?

> Additional reason - I would like to ask people about their experience (using escrow).

During the initial research realized that privacy of the escrow is very important and in the first weeks of my work I would like to focus on that.

### Vote "NO"

- Nothing personal.
- Do what is in your best interest as a token holder. Doing anything else would be irrational.
- I'd probably reduce my stack of PNK to `0.5m` and let the other guys do the work with the full confidence there are others better than me.
- Surely I'd reduce my activity on the Telegram, Forum, Slack and other channels to reclaim my time and focus on other money making activities.
- In fact, I'll reduce my Telegram trolling one way or another. You'll still be able to find me in Github commits, technical discussions on Slack and in-depth post on the Forum.
- I will vote to hire me with my own stack because I know it's in my own best interest as a person, as well as the PNK holder. 
- **DYOR**
- Even if the outcome of the vote is "NO" I'm hoping to earn some PNK via [storytelling bounty](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-storytelling-reward-program/).

### Applicable law
- I'm originally from Europe.
- I have established my first limited company in the UK in 2011.
- I have opened a company in [E-Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Estonia) in 2017.
- Kleros Cooperative is a French entity.
- Any dispute to be resolved by the Kleros court, employment arbitration category (to be created).

### Discussion
- I encourage discussion and feedback.
- I encourage the existing core team to comment and vote with their PNK, in fact I want to make it the highest attendance vote ever.
- https://governance.kleros.io/ - so far the votes attracted up to 4%... I'd really to see 10% turnout, that would be amazing, with new token holders *(2nd round of sale)* I believe it is possible!

### Meta-meta-meta-marketing
- Forum post with decentralized job application job offer is **marketing**.
- Google Doc asking for your input is **marketing**.
- Asking to vote with your PNK is **marketing** *(it shows that DAOs can make decisions, thrive, operate fast)*.
