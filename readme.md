# Decentralized job application - PNK token holders to decide


TLDR:
- I was thinking about working with Kleros for a long time.
- I was waiting for the right timing (around the 2nd round token sale).
- I spoke with Federico and Stuart suggesting some improvements to [escrow](https://escrow.kleros.io).

### Why escrow?
I have reported 20+ [issues](https://github.com/kleros/escrow/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Amarsrobertson):

We need to be better.
I am taking ownership of that piece.
I suggest hourly rate for the start.
We could think forever about milestones.
Not possible to know exactly the scope of the work before doing some work first.
Fast moving decentralized startups need to operate fast.

2016-2017 I was earning £500 + VAT per day. £600 was $800, that equals $100 per hour.

*(bank famous for laundering money, I was using stairs most of the time to avoid weird interactiong in the elevators)

Currently on £76k salary that equals to $100k year.

According to the [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/b428ed1a/London) I'm in the 90 percentile of software engineer salaries in London.

Here is what I suggest:

$50 per hour (half of my old rate)
10 hours per week

Try before you buy. Do not marry on the first date. 

Generously compensated in stock options (PNK vested) to ensure aligned incentives. How much exactly?

1% (10m) 4 years vesting with 6 months cliff.

1% is

### Internal motivation

2017 messy divorce
2 years write off
4 different court threads (divorce, children, money, non-molestation)
10 hearings


### Google Doc
Initial guidellines in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axqQAOVhtR8fFV63W1J5BNC4uTxJYEwt0i9GZPDNxOo/edit?usp=sharing).

As a way summary:
> The section above talks primarily about user research: personas, target, value proposition, reduce friction, adoption.
> > It's important to really drill down at the specifics of the use case, at knowing exactly who will be the user and how will the transaction happen.
> I’m thinking about my primary skill set -  I have skills as a developer.
> I can surely fork the smart contract and make the necessary adjustments.
> I am familiar with the Solidity codebase.
> In fact, I've already earned some profit: https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/issues/243#issuecomment-491905442
> I am less familiar with the React front-end but if needed can make necessary fixes too: https://github.com/kleros/escrow/pull/68
> I think about the balance, best of both worlds:
> * Phase 1: User research first so we know exactly what we are doing
> * Phase 2: Then developing the functionalities

> Can we make this Google Doc public?
> This is because it will be PNK holders who would vote whether to hire me.
> I would like them to know the existing results of my work - it will help them make better, more informed decisions.
> Additional reason - I would like to ask people about their experience (using escrow). Some use cases require more work. We were discussing creating a blog post with “call for research”. This Google Doc is a solid base na I would like to create a long-form blogpost in the official channels.

The [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axqQAOVhtR8fFV63W1J5BNC4uTxJYEwt0i9GZPDNxOo/edit?usp=sharing) contains the current results of my work.


### Vote against

Nothing personal.

Do what is in your best interest as a token holder.

I'll probably reduce my stack of PNK to `0.5m` and let the other guys do the work.

Surely I'll reduce my activity on the Telegram, Forum, Slack and other channels to reclaim my time and focus on other money making activities.

I will vote to hire me with my own stack because I know it's in my own best interest as a person, as well as the PNK holder.


### Applicable law

I'm originally from Europe.

I have established my first limited company in the UK in 2011

2017 I have opened a company in E-Estonia (now defunct)

Kleros Cooperative is a French entity.
 
Any dispute to be resolved by the Kleros court, employment arbitration category (to be created)



### Discussion
I encourage discussion and feedback.
I encourage the existing core team to comment and vote with their PNK, in fact I want to make it the highest attendance vote ever.

### Meta-meta-meta-marketing.
Forum post with decentralized job application job offer is marketing.
Google Doc asking for feedback is marketing.
Asking to vote with your PNK is marketing - it shows that DAOs can operate, make decisions, thrive.


### Closing remards
That’s why Chief Integration Officer

Integrating legacy society infrastructure into new paradigm decentralised ecosystem
